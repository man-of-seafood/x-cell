# X-Cell

Welcome to the X-cell app!

This is a microscopic "spreadsheet" app that will knock your socks off, even if you have exceptionally large socks. 

## Feature spec

It provides you with a small Excel-like interface. Currently, the only feature it provides is the summing of numeric values and the display of that sum at the bottom of each column.
