# X-Cell

Welcome to the X-cell app!

This is a microscopic "spreadsheet" app that will knock your socks off, even if you have exceptionally large socks. 

## Feature spec

It provides you with a small Excel-like interface. Currently, it provides two features:  
1. Summing each of the columns in a lime-green sum row.  
2. Adding columns to the spreadsheet via the 'Add Column' button
